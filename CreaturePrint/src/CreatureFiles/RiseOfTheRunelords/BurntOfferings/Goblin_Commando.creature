Before Combat:The goblin commando has already imbibed a #Ipotion #Iof #Irage for his fight against the dog and has 2 rounds remaining on its duration (likely the surprise round and the first round of combat).
During Combat:The commando makes sure to use his Mounted Combat feat to try to negate an attack each round against his mount, and uses his superior mobility to remain out of melee so he can shoot at the PCs with his bow from dogback (taking the standard â€“4 penalty for using a ranged weapon while mounted). If all of his goblin warriors are defeated, he drops his bow and races in to fight the PCs in melee.
Morale: The commando fights to the death.
