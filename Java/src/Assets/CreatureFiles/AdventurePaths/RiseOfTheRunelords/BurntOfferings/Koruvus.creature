During Combat: Koruvus takes his duty as guardian of this chamber seriously, and immediately attacks anyone who enters the room. He uses his breath weapon on the first round of combat, then moves in to engage the largest, most dangerous-looking foe with his weapons.
Morale: Koruvus fights to the death, and pursues foes all the way to the glassworks or the northern exit if necessary before returning here.
