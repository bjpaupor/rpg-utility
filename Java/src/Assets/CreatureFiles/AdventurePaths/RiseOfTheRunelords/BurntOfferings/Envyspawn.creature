Before Combat: 
During Combat: A sinspawn that faces a single foe generally attempts to capture its enemy alive, making untrained Heal checks to stop bleeding if necessary, so the victim can be returned to the nearest runewell before he is murdered. Against multiple foes, the sinspawn focuses its attacks on the weakest-looking foes first.
Morale: Sinspawn fight to the death.

Special Ability Name :Scent Sin (Su)
Description: A sinspawn has the scent ability, but only against extraordinarily envious creatures. This includes any creature under the effects of a barbarian rage or similar effect, a creature with the evil subtype, a creature under the effects of the sinspawn’s envious bite, or a creature (GM’s discretion) that is excessively envious.
Number of Sub categories : 0
Special Ability Name : Envious Bite (Su)
Description:A creature bitten by a sinspawn must make a DC 12 Will save or become overwhelmed by feelings of envy, anger, and rage. These emotions are so powerful that the affected creature finds it hard to do anything but rage impotently. For 1d6 minutes after succumbing to a sinspawn’s envious bite, the victim is effectively sickened, and takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A victim suffering from this effect who is bitten again by a sinspawn must make a DC 12 Will save or the envy increases, leaving him staggered and thus able to take only a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions). Further bites increase the duration of the effect, but not the magnitude.
